What is a service animal? A service animal should have a task that directly helps its handler in any way.

I try to use service animals for tasks that can help me be better.  One of their tasks that they are schooled at is water quality specialist.  I discovered the Flint Water Crisis in 2013, about two years before the Flint Water Crisis was officially scrutinized and announced.
