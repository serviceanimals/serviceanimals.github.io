"I didn't do it," 3/4 would quack while fleeing/running.
"Build it like feathers," Falcon would gobble while observing.
"Jamaica," the ducks would sing as the weather cooled in the fall/early winter in 2021.
"We're in heaven," the ducks would sing in summer 2021 as the would splash their pond with wingtips.
Chester 2 and Ostrich:  Service duck Chester 2 caught my attention and focused his on service turkey hen Ostrich.  He began plodding up to Ostrich who was sulking by the six foot tall wooden partition fence.  At times he would focus his gaze between Ostrich, who he was rapidly approaching, and my musing gaze at the unfolding scene;  My turkey hen gobble crying and standing immobile next to the fence and my American Pekin duck rapidly approaching it with cooing vocals.
